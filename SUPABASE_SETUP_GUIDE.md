# Supabase Database Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up the complete Supabase database schema for the Slick e-commerce website, making it a fully functional real-world application.

## Prerequisites
- Supabase project created
- Database URL and anon key configured in `.env.local`
- Admin access to your Supabase project

## Database Schema Setup

### 1. Run the Schema Script
Execute the SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of supabase-schema.sql
```

### 2. What Gets Created

#### Tables:
- **`orders`** - Main order records with customer info, totals, and status
- **`order_items`** - Individual items within each order
- **`order_status_history`** - Track status changes over time

#### Features:
- **Automatic order numbering** - Generates unique order numbers like `ORD-20241201-1234`
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Users can only see their own orders, admins see all
- **Status tracking** - Automatic history when order status changes
- **Real-time updates** - Built-in triggers for status changes

#### Security:
- Users can only view/edit their own orders
- Admins have full access to all orders
- Secure by default with RLS policies

## How It Works

### Customer Flow:
1. **Add to Cart** → Items stored in localStorage
2. **Checkout** → Order created in Supabase with customer details
3. **Order Items** → Each cart item becomes an order_item record
4. **Success Page** → Fetches real order data from database
5. **Order Details** → Full order history and status tracking

### Admin Flow:
1. **Order Management** → View all orders with filtering
2. **Status Updates** → Change order status (pending → processing → shipped → delivered)
3. **Order Details** → Full customer and item information
4. **Real-time Updates** → Changes reflect immediately

## Key Features

### Order Status Flow:
- **Pending** → Order just created, awaiting processing
- **Processing** → Order being prepared for shipment
- **Shipped** → Order sent to customer
- **Delivered** → Order completed
- **Cancelled** → Order cancelled

### Payment Integration Ready:
- Payment method tracking
- Payment status (pending, paid, failed, refunded)
- Ready for Stripe/PayPal integration

### Customer Experience:
- Real order numbers for tracking
- Email confirmations (ready for implementation)
- Order history accessible anytime
- Status updates visible to customers

## Testing the Setup

### 1. Create a Test Order:
1. Add items to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Fill out shipping form
4. Complete order
5. Check success page shows real data

### 2. Admin Testing:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Orders page
3. View order details
4. Update order status
5. Verify changes reflect

### 3. Customer Testing:
1. Login as regular user
2. View order history
3. Check order details
4. Verify can only see own orders

## Next Steps

### Email Notifications:
- Set up Supabase Edge Functions for email sending
- Order confirmation emails
- Status update notifications

### Payment Integration:
- Stripe integration for real payments
- PayPal integration
- Cash on delivery handling

### Inventory Management:
- Stock level tracking
- Low stock alerts
- Automatic stock updates

### Analytics:
- Order analytics dashboard
- Sales reporting
- Customer insights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **RLS Policy Errors** → Ensure policies are created correctly
2. **Order Not Found** → Check order ID format and user permissions
3. **Status Update Failures** → Verify admin permissions

### Debug Steps:
1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify RLS policies are active
3. Test with different user roles
4. Check network requests in browser dev tools

## Security Notes

- All customer data is protected by RLS
- Admin access requires proper authentication
- Order data is encrypted at rest
- No sensitive payment data stored (use Stripe/PayPal)

Your Slick e-commerce website is now a fully functional, real-world application with proper database integration, security, and order management!
